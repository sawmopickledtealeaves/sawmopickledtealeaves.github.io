The uses for that extra patch of fabric are greater than one realizes until one has it. Our pocket tee is made in a midweight, durable, certified organic cotton that gets softer over time. This T-shirt is certified organic—from seed to shirt. The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certification takes over a year to account for every step of production—from the processing of certified organic fiber into yarn, to the dyehouses, mills, factories, and printers.\u003c\/span\u003e","brand":"uneo","offers":[{"title":"Black","offer_id":39286727934042,"sku":"","price":18.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"White","offer_id":39286727966810,"sku":"","price":18.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0076\/1708\/5530\/products\/201.png?v=1617454361","url":"https:\/\/uneo.myshopify.com\/products\/the-pocket-tee","provider":"uneo","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
