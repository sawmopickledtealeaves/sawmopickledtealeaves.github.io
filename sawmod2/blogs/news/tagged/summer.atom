      <![CDATA[<p>Even though most of Utah has fully opened up – we’ve been having fun doing some quick family work outs. Sometimes they are 30 minutes other days they are 10 minutes, it’s just a fun way to play as a family.</p>
<p>FAMILY SQUATS:</p>
<p>I hold ollie in the front and Cody throws Beckam on his back for a little extra weight.  My legs are still burning from the other day haha.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<span>Fruit prints are back on the rise this summer and the high-schooler in me is here for it. It feels like such a throwback and I love the way it’s bringing in so many colors to this seasons print trends! </span><a href="https://bit.ly/2RlKj8f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external">Summersalt</a><span> just launched their </span><a href="https://bit.ly/2BwoNZc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external">Cherries collection</a><span> and Mara and I both got a few pieces. It’s been so much fun twinning with her, especially now that’s she’s starting to fit into some of the brands I love and wear a lot. </span><a href="https://bit.ly/38gfI2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external">This wrap skirt</a><span> is one of my favorite pieces – it comes in multiple prints and so good as a beach cover up but can also transition to brunch or dinner out with a cropped tee or bodysuit. The perfect vacation piece! Right now you can get $10 towards your order with code: HELLOFASHION10 (orders over $95).</span>]]>
